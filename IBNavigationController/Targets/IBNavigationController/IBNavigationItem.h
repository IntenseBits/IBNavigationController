/**
 * There are three ways to supply toolbar items in Interface builder.
 * 1) Define button titles as custom runtime attributes of the view controller and supply a block in code to handle the click
 * 2) Define NSButton, add it to the Root view and tag it 1001 or 1002 and drag a segue to the controller to push.
	  Certain properties of the button will be extracted and copied to our buttons we have defined in the
	  IBNavigationProxyViewController nib
 * 3) Define ANY NSView subclass, add it to the root view and set its Identifier to "1001" or "1002".
	  The view will be extracted and inserted into the navigation bar stack view, replacing the existing NSButton 1 or 2
 *	
 * If you supply more than one in IB The order in which they are used are top to bottom, i.e 3 overrides 1
